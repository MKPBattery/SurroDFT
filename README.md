# SurroDFT

SurroDFT is a decentralized platform for AI-driven DFT (Density Functional Theory) molecular and material property approximation. The project combines GPU-accelerated graph neural network inference, autonomous AI agent coordination, and token incentive systems.

### PoM: Proof of Materials (2025。11)

SurroDFT also serves as the computational backbone for PoM (Proof of Materials) — a materials-backed decentralized value system where material performance metrics (energy density, diffusivity, stability, band structure, etc.) are mapped to token issuance and decentralized economic incentives.

The PoM concept is documented in:  
👉 PoM.md in this repository.
