# SurroDFT

SurroDFT is a decentralized platform for AI-driven DFT (Density Functional Theory) molecular and material property approximation. The project combines GPU-accelerated graph neural network inference, autonomous AI agent coordination, and token incentive systems.

## Features

- Graph Neural Network (GNN) based molecular and material property prediction
- Multi-GPU node distributed computing support
- Decentralized storage and verification mechanisms
- Token economic system incentives
- On-chain/off-chain digital asset storage

## Technical Architecture

- Task Initiation and Structure Input Layer
- AI Agent Inference Layer
- Agent Coordination and Verification Layer
- Decentralized Storage and Token Incentive Settlement Layer

## Development Status

The project is currently in initial development phase. For detailed technical whitepaper, please refer to [whitepaper.md](whitepaper.md).
